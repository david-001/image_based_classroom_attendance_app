# Application for Image Based Classroom Attendance System

A class attendance system called ECNG Class Attendance was developed and tested. This 
system is comprised of an Android application, a Windows application and a webserver. An 
image is captured from an Android smartphone with a 13 MP camera or selected from the 
smartphoneâ€™s  storage  using  the  Android  application.  The  image  is  then  uploaded  to  the 
webserver using the Android application. The attendance record is updated and retrieved using 
a PC with the Windows application.
